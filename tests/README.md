# Running tests

All Tests are simply run with the command:

```bash
npm test
```

However you can be a little more fine grain with the following commands:

```bash
# Run linter only
npm run test:lint

# Run unit/integration tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run end-to-end tests only
npm run test:e2e
```

# Writing tests with JEST

Writing tests for any JS code has to be made with [Jest](https://jestjs.io)

We added a few extensions to Jest to makes our life easier

 - [`jest-extended`](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-extended#readme) to have more nicer matchers
 - [`jest-dom`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#readme) and [`user-event`](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-user-event) to make testing of DOM stuff easier
 - [`jest-axe`](https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe#readme) because we obviously want to check for minimal accessibility requirements on our components

That said, [we are using Jest in ESM mode](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules) which requires to be careful as it requires some tweaking to work smoothly. Basically if you want to access the `jest` object in your test files you need to import it manually:

```js
import { jest } from '@jest/globals'
```

For both `user-event` and `jest-axe` the import isn't straightforward (_because building tools yada yadaâ€¦_) so you need to do a two step import:

```js
import jestAxe from 'jest-axe'
import userEvent from 'user-event'

const { axe, configureAxe } = jestAxe // toHaveNoViolations is already set
const {
  clear, click, deselectOptions, dbClick, hover, keyboard,
  past, selectOptions, tab, type, unhover, upload
} = userEvent.default
```
